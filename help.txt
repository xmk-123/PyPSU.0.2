adapter green + white to sensor white
adapter red to sensor red
adapter black to sensor black

4k7 resistor between red and white of sensor (between red and green/white of adapter)

________

Heating block

a series of power resistors , mounted on a heatsink where the DUT will be mounted too
MUST update the parameters on the application before use.
menu- parameters

__________

Step by step usage instructions

run curvetracegui.py

1) update the heating block parametes  Menu - parameters
    skip if no heating block used
2) open the PSU setup window by clicking either of the red/grey buttons named "PSU"
    2.1) From the the "PSUs list" listbox , select the PSU
    2.2) From the the "Ports list" listbox , select the port that the psu is connected on
    2.3) Press the button under the PSUs list listbox that is reads: "Connect" and the PSU name
            The connected PSU will apear in the "Available PSUs" listbox
    2.4) repeat above for the rest of the PSUs

    2.5)Drag and Drop from the "Available PSUs" listbox, the PSU into either the
        "in use by Vgs PSU"
        "in use by Vds PSU"
        "in use by Heater"
        listboxes
    2.6) Under the Vgs and Vds listboxes and under the "Test" buttons , you can select the polarity of the PSU.
           This does not affect physically the PSU. It is for the correct sign in the graph and tracing data.
    2.7) The changed listbox will turn red. Press the button named "Create" to create the virtual PSUs
    2.8)Select the sensor in the "sensor list" and the port in the "ports list" and then press the button "connect sensor"
           under the sensor listbox. No need to press "create".
    2.9) You can disconnect the created PSUs by draging then in the "available PSUs" listbox, select them and press "disconnect"
    2.10) Press exit
3) on the main window,
    3.1) on the right side enter the start,end step voltages for the trace.
    Enter the max current allowed and the max power allowed. These are the limits that the PSU will have.
    In other words the DUT will not be subject to higher values.
    3.2) if a temperature sensor is present, enter the temperature that the trace should use.
        The app will wait until the temperature is at this number and stable.
    3.3) repeat 3.1 for the Vgs PSU on the left side. This can be left empty if you are measuring a diode etc.
            Also the current should be 0 in case of MOSFET
    3.4) All these settings and the PSU setup can be saved in order for the app to begin with these next time you open the app.
            Go to menu-save startup settings.
            To reset got to menu-clear startup settings
4)  Press the button in the middle to start the tracing procedure. At any time Press stop to stop.

5)  Once the trace is complete , you can save the data by pressing "save" button on the top right side of the trace window
    There is also a smooth checkbox and a plot power limit checkbox.

6)  There is a second TAB named "Match"
    6.1) press "Load curve" button to load saved curves. On the listbox , select the curves to show.
    6.2) select only one curve from the listbox , and press "Set base curve" to indicate the base curve.
    6.3)select only one curve from the listbox , and press "quantify" button below the plot window,
    to quantify the differences between the base curve and the selected curve in the listbox
    6.4) Press "clear base set" to remove the base set. Press "delete curve" to remove the curve set from the listbox
